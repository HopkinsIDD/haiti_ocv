# Achieving coordinated national immunity and cholera elimination in Haiti through vaccination

This repository presents the supplementary texts for the manuscript "Achieving coordinated national immunity and cholera elimination in Haiti through vaccination".

## Documents
* `Main_Supplement.pdf`: Primary supplement document that describes the modeling exercise and summarizes results across teams.
* `Model-1_Supplement.pdf`: Supplementary methods and results from Model-1 from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
* `Model-2_Supplement.pdf`: Supplementary methods and results from Model-2 from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Florida.
* `Model-3_Supplement.pdf`: Supplementary methods and results from Model-3 from Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne.
* `Model-4 Supplement.pdf`: Supplementary methods and results from Model-4 from the Institute for Disease Modeling.

## Team Outputs
This folder contains the following team model outputs at two elimination thresholds (thresh1 = less than 1 infection per 10000 population, or thresh2 = less than 1 case with no resurgence over a consecutive 52 week period):
* `elimdate_...`: weekdate of elimination for each model simulation and vaccine deployment scenario
* `pr_elim_...`: probability of elimination and cumulative number of infections for a given vaccine deployment scenario
* `ts_...`: time series projections of true cholera infections and observed cholera cases for each vaccine deployment scenario
* `tte_...`: time to elimination summary statistics for each vaccine deployment scenario
